### An analysis about urban inequities in air quality
For decades, the US mortgage industry systematically denied mortgages to people of color through the practice of red-lining, which institutionalized racial segregation. This project team’s analysis focuses on Seattle, linking the city’s history of red-lining with current air pollution levels and health trends. Their data suggests that previously red-lined areas suffer from higher rates of pollution and asthma today than communities zoned as “desirable” in the 1940s. It also finds that people of color are currently underrepresented in air monitoring coverage in Seattle.
