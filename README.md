## Instructions for the Team:

* Each folder is meant to store your work/notebooks for safekeeping. It is recommended that you also keep a copy of your work in your own repo.
* If there are files within your local directory that you do not wish to push to GitHub, create a .gitignore file and include:
> name_of_file.file_extension (ex: config.py)
> /file_directory (ex: /heavy_dataset)
* Here is a common git workflow for reference:
$ git init
$ git status
$ git pull https://github.com/HP-Nunes/Academy-of-Py.git
$ git add . #
$ git commit -m "COMMENTS ABOUT UPDATE/FILES"
$ git push origin master
/OR git push https://github.com/HP-Nunes/Academy-of-Py.git master
$ git status
